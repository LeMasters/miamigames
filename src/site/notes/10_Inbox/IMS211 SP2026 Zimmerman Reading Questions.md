Here are a few reading questions that may help you make some sense of Zimmerman's chapter on "Play."

1. Zimmerman defines play as "free movement within a more rigid structure." Take a moment and enumerate a few examples of play from class the other day. Can you situate them in this metaphor ("free movement within a more rigid structure")?

2. Why does Zimmerman insist that play is an _activity_ rather than _content_? What changes when designers (game designers, sure, but marketers, too) think of themselves as "party hosts" instead of content creators?

3. Zimmerman argues that unwritten rules shape play just as much as formal game rules. What's an example of an unwritten rule from your own gaming experience, and what happens when someone violates it?
