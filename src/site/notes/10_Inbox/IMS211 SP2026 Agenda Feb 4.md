## Agenda

For next week
Today: Thinking about play
Exquisite Corpse
Your "play" notebook

Miro exercise (+ intro to Miro)

A few ideas about PLAY
Proposed qualities of PLAY

---

For next week: Zimmerman on Monday
Start with Edith Finch on Wednesday
Wed we'll also talk about strategies for playing critically

(and important to acknowledge: If we're going with the idea that GAMES are maybe a more significant medium than we often acknowledge, then MAYBE we have to ask, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT the WAY I PLAY GAMES is NOT ENOUGH? Is it possible that GAMES deserve to be played MORE THOUGHTFULLY, MORE CAREFULLY, than we already do? IS IT POSSIBLE -- and maybe even IMPORTANT -- to become better gamers as we get older)?

We'll also discuss the first dialogue that is due, talk about what it looks like, set up a rubric so you know how to succeed, and pair you up with your first partner.

Apropos of "Edith Finch"
Does everyone know Steam? Quick discussion if you're not familiar. Feel free to friend me on Steam: I'm either 
Garrison 
OR 
glemasters

Can also go through Good Old Games (GOG.COM); cheapest on iPad (4.99), but I haven't investigated how well that version works, you'll probably need a keyboard attached. Also on the SWITCH, and on XBOX, PS, and Microsoft Store.  

Whatever you choose -- it is relevant, and worth discussing: How does gameplay of the same game across different platforms change the experience?

### Exquisite Corpse

Let's play exquisite corpse. It will be... weird. I ask you give me the benefit of the doubt. We'll play it, I'll ask you to explain it, and then we'll set it aside and come back to it later, to see if it makes more sense to us.

 ADJECTIVE 
 NOUN 
 VERB 
 
 ADJECTIVE 
 NOUN.

FUN
nonsensical
unpredictable
flexible
randomization; collaboration
not productive (traditional way)


Gather some student reactions:
	What is going on here?
	How does this activity compare to other activities you do in classes around the university?
	Why is this (not) interesting in a course about games / play?
	Why did we do this?

### Notes from Your PLAY Notebook

NB: I'm not collecting these, or checking these, but when I ask you to participate by collecting observations, or doing research, I need you to do that. I can check up on you, but I'd prefer a world in which I just trust you to do it, and then you just do it.

We NEED to come up with a definition for PLAY. You probably have a working definition in mind, but it is probably a bit vague. That's great. Let's see what we can do.

Go back to your PLAY NOTEBOOKS.

#### Exercise Overview

Here's how this will work:

You'll work in pairs

3 minutes for one person to identify (a) the most boring and (b) the weirdest things you wrote down. Explain why you thought of these as play. Between the two of you come to agreement on what counts as a KIND OF PLAY, and which are probably NOT play. Circle the best and weirdest in your notebook.

Again, we don't have a definition yet, so just make your best guess.

THEN WE'LL SWITCH: 3 minutes as you review the best, weirdest, most boring, most playful entries in your 24 hour PLAY notebook.

SO after those 6 minutes total, you should both have a short list of THINGS THAT DEFINITELY COUNT AS PLAY, things that MIGHT BE PLAY, and then things THAT ARE DEFINITELY NOT PLAY.

Then we'll work on adding your best entries to our online map.

But first get started with reviewing your notebook.  

#### EXERCISE

1st, pair up -- in groups of 2 exclusively, if you can't find a partner tell me.  

Now one of you:  
3 minutes for one person to identify (a) the most boring and (b) the weirdest things you wrote down. Explain why you thought of these as play. Between the two of you come to agreement on what counts as a KIND OF PLAY, and which are probably NOT play. Circle the best and weirdest in your notebook.

NOW SWITCH
3 minutes for one person to identify (a) the most boring and (b) the weirdest things you wrote down. Explain why you thought of these as play. Between the two of you come to agreement on what counts as a KIND OF PLAY, and which are probably NOT play. Circle the best and weirdest in your notebook.

Now let's take a look at MIRO
Make sure you SIGN IN WITH YOUR NAME, not anonymous

Quick intro to MIRO

Now with the ideas you found with your partner, put up some of the best, worst, weirdest, things you observed in your play diary. Put down at LEAST TWO THINGS from your diary.

EXAMPLE:
FRIENDS PLAY POKER in my room
Best friend and I binge watch TV shows together
Take car to carwash

HORIZONTALLY from 
DEFINITELY NOT PLAY to 
DEFINITELY PLAY

and
VERTICALLY from 
BORING to 
WEIRD/SURPRISING

Review these collectively
What are some of the ideas we have about PLAY>

## Play

WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO REALLY DELVE INTO PLAY. OUR FOCUS HERE IS SUPERFICIAL AND PROBABLY RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN IT ANSWERS.

BUT FUNDAMENTALLY, it is IMPERATIVE that you understand that when we STUDY GAMES, every GAME is LINKED BACKWARDS TO A BIGGER CONCEPT CALLED PLAY.

AND NO MATTER HOW WELL we come to understand GAMES, they are connected to PLAY, which means they are still bigger and more mysterious than we understand.  

Here's the point that is kind of hard to understand:
1. Play is NOTHING. Play is negligible. Acts of play are pointless, and have no effect on the world, and disappear without a trace;
2. Play is EVERYTHING. Play is the reason we have civilization, science, religion; language -- all language is play; every work of art is the outcome of play.
3. Play is the future. The likelihood of a species surviving from one generation to the next is directly proportional to their ability to play.

Our challenge this semester is to figure out (1) what is play, and (2) how do games relate to play?

---

Start with this: People (and animals, and insects, and probably even some plants) have probably been playing since day 1. It seems to be a behavior, a thing most living things do.

We've identified moments of play from our daily lives, DOODLING on a RECEIPT, 'Don't Step on a Crack', making a JOKE, but when you think about it, PLAY is much bigger than this:

Most ART is a kind of play. Theatre is full of PLAYS, but these literally are PLAY. Music is an exercise in PLAY. Stand-up comedy. Movies. Novels. Video games, table-top games, thumb-wrestling. Sex, conversations, dinner parties, the way you dress yourself in the morning. THESE CAN OFTEN BE UNDERSTOOD AS ACTS/FORMS of PLAY.

IF you think of NATURE and THE UNIVERSE as always looking for the PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE, FOR THE EASIEST ROUTE (think of the way water flows, for example) then PLAY SEEMS LIKE THE OPPOSITE.

SO IT IS REASONABLE that SCIENCE would want to make sense of all of those instances of PLAY I cited above (many of which could also be labeled "ART"). Your novel is full of lots of moral advice: Wouldn't it be easier to just write down the advice in a list? Getting dressed is hard: Wouldn't it make more sense to just have one outfit you wear every day? Instead of spending 2 hours listening to a concert, wouldn't it have the same impact on my brain to just get high and be done with it?

Cause that's how science works:

Science works through reduction. We're constantly taking big things (objects, processes) and reducing them to smaller component parts. This is what science does, and it does it well.

Think of the scene in a science fiction movie when a spaceship enters the atmosphere of an unknown planet and the science officer says: "Atmosphere is 95% CO2, 2.7% Nitrogen, 1.6% Argon, 1.1% Oxygen."

That is Science *par excellence*: **Reduction**. Take a mysterious thing, analyze it, reveal its component parts, so we can better deal with it.

Science can go even further, obviously:

> Carbon Dioxide is a compound, we can reduce it to a single carbon molecule and an oxygen molecule.

> Science keeps going: An oxygen molecule (O2) is actually 2 oxygen atoms. The oxygen atom has a nucleus of 8 protons + 8 or more neutrons, orbited by 8 electrons.

Science keeps going: What comprises one of those electrons? We move into the sub-atomic.

This isn't just in chemistry: All scientific inquiry adopts this attitude.

---

So at the turn of the 20th century, Science was pulling apart the world to see its component parts.  

Most of human history had depended on God as "**the prime mover**," as "**the first cause**," so that for centuries, no matter how much you reduced things, you always came to the same answer: Why does Oxygen have 8 electrons? Because God said so.

BUT the 20th Century West had decided that God was no longer a sufficient answer — and Science doubted he was really in charge — so like a really annoying 5-year old, Science was asking "yeah but why" constantly.

For the most part, that was productive.

The monkey is eating the apple.
Why is he eating the apple.
Because he's hungry.
Why is he hungry?
Hunger = low energy/nutrient availability -> triggers hormone release -> brain perceives need -> urge to eat.

What matters here is that every aspect of this "feeling" -- I'm hungry -- can get reduced to chemical compounds, biological drives, evolutionary needs.

SO then in the 20th Century, science asks: What about play, what about theater, music, art, sex without the intention of reproduction, avant-garde fashion shows in Paris: How can we make sense of it REDUCTIVELY, in an essential way?

WHY? Because from a SCIENTIFIC point of view, play is SUSPECT: Watch kids on a playground, joyfully, happily, stupidly running around, playing on monkey bars, trying to go as high as possible on the swingset, wrestling in the dirt, etc.

IT MAKES NO SENSE. They are using up extra energy that animals need to preserve in order to survive; they potentially subject themselves to ligament tears, broken bones, social ostracism; they are not helping their parents store food for the winter, they are not learning about how to make weapons for hunting, etc., etc. IT MAKES NO SENSE. SO there's GOT TO BE an explanation.

---

SO early 20th C scientists came up with 4 reasons we PLAY. They managed to REDUCE play -- across most species of animal, invertebrate, etc. -- to this:

**Excess energy theory** (Schiller, Spencer, late 19th c.)
Play = *venting surplus energy not required for survival work.*

**Preparation / Practice theory** (Groos, early 20th c.)
Play = *instinctual rehearsal for adult skills (e.g., kittens "play-hunting").*

**Recapitulation theory** (Hall, late 19th–early 20th c.)
Play = *reenactment of evolutionary stages (children "play at" primitive hunting, etc.).*

**Relaxation theory** (Lazarus, late 19th c.)
Play = *restoration of energy spent in work.*

---

BUT in the 1930s Dutch historian JOHAN HUIZINGA watches Naziism steamroll Europe and feels like our HUMANITY is being REDUCED by SCIENCE to a bunch of equations, which is making it much easier to justify the kind of MONSTROSITIES that the Nazis are committing.

And one of his ideas is that SCIENCE totally misunderstands what it means to be human. He looks at their UTILITARIAN, ESSENTIALIST, INSTRUMENTALIZED, REDUCTIVE ideas about PLAY and rejects them.  

The book HOMO LUDENS, man the player, is an attempt to REDEFINE PLAY in a NEW WAY.

Here's what he says about PLAY

Voluntary
>Play is free and chosen. The moment it becomes compulsory, it loses its play-quality.

Not ordinary / outside real life
>Play is a stepping outside of necessity or seriousness. It's distinct from work, survival, or duty, even though it can feel very serious while it's happening.

Bounded in time and space
>Play happens within set limits — a beginning and end, a playground, a board, a field, a magic circle.

Rule-governed / orderly
>Play has its own order. Players accept rules, even if arbitrary, and those rules structure the activity.

Unproductive (in material terms)
>Play doesn't create goods or wealth; no utility. Its value is intrinsic to the act itself.

Creates special meaning & social groupings
>Play generates its own sense of meaning and can form groups (playing together) that feel set apart from the everyday world.

In the end: Play's "essence" isn't exhausted by its biological or social functions. EVEN IF YOU EXPLAIN PLAY AWAY WITH REDUCTIVE FUNCTIONALISM, IT SURE SEEMS LIKE THERE IS MORE TO IT.

### Thinking Critically About NITW

On your own, 3 minutes: When someone says that they are "reading a novel" or "watching a movie" or "listening to an album" and that they are doing it CRITICALLY, what does that mean to you? What does it mean to "read critically?" What is/are the point(s)? Give that some thought and jot down your best ideas.

COLLECT THESE

So when someone asks this of you, what are some of your strategies? What do you do to ensure that you are "critically reading a novel?" Spend 3 minutes at your table coming up with the best STRATEGIES for "reading a novel critically."

IDENTIFY THESE

Now spend 4 minutes with your group. Imagine your little brother comes to you and says, we're supposed to play a video game critically for class. What are some of the strategies you would tell him to follow? Create a list of at least 4 things. If you get to four, add more, and then improve your list.

IDENTIFY THESE in a DOCUMENT
