## Agenda

Sorry this is unformatted, etc.
FRAME / RECAP
Continue to EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY SPACES that RHETORIC occupies
A (last-minute) example: *They Live!* from John Carpenter

#### Framing. Brief Recap of Monday's Premise

You'll hear me riff on these themes frequently this semester. They point to a complex set of ideas that I think we can deepen as we go along.

Most essentially: Rhetoric is PERSUASION
Traditionally, a Classical practice associated with Aristotle, etc.
Lately, in our language, Rhetoric is associated with bad things
Deceit, deception, lying, pointless language
"That politician was just spewing a bunch of Rhetoric"
(As is always the case, we can blame PLATO for this, really)


But we want to complicate these ideas:
(rhetoric is an intuitive practice);
(rhetoric is not just SPEECH, but can be visual, aural, even procedural);
Even more complicated / challenging:
(rhetoric creates worlds);
(rhetoric is NOT only EPISTEMOLOGICAL but ONTOLOGICAL);
(rhetoric is about being);

Another possibility we want to entertain (i.e., think about) -- 
Prompted by Savannah's interest in *Superman* (Gunn, 2025):

Rhetoric is NOT just me trying to exercise POWER over you
(I want you to believe X or Y, or feel Z);
Instead, RHETORIC isn't about YOU vs. ME but is about US;
Superman is a powerful alien, but his desire is to ERASE difference

That is a situation that 20th C rhetoric dealt with

Parable of Tower of Babel maybe gives us a way of thinking about this:
Everyone speaks the same language, universal understanding, building a massive tower in their Unity;
God asks them not to do so; they do it anyway.
In some stories, God strikes down the tower, and creates division so that everyone speaks a different language and is geographically scattered
(Among other things) a metaphor for our SEPERATENESS, our LONELY INDEPENDENCE

Powerful idea that runs through media: We don't know our neighbors. (We are all victims of the Tower of Babel).
Movie clip: *They Live!* by the great John Carpenter (*The Thing*, 1982)

Good for at least two reasons:

1st, Rowdy Roddy Piper discovers how rhetoric covers things up and can be dispelled to reveal the menace behind it.
Fine, but
2nd, he also confronts the idea that MAYBE WE CANNOT KNOW EACH OTHER. (His neighbors are monstrous aliens)....

To my mind, MAYBE John Carpenter's view is CYNICAL.
Maybe it is hung up on RHETORIC as a form of POWER.
 
One DIFFERENT possibility (and this is the one that Wayne Booth subscribes to): Maybe RHETORIC is a powerful means of OVERCOMING that loneliness, that impossible barrier between YOU and ME, and coming to some kind of SHARED UNDERSTANDING of the world.  

Booth calls this "Listening Rhetoric," which is a bit awkward, but I think you see what he's up to here.

#### Today's Goal (harvest and Formalize what We observed)

Individual work: Take your notes and put them into Miro, beginning to formalize them. 

Then in small groups: Help refine some of those notes, make them clearer; add brief examples if you need to (could come from the presentations, or be imagined examples). GO AHEAD AND ADD your own NAMES for these STRATEGIES -- not ethos or logos, but "COMMUNITY-BUILDING" or "LOGICAL BEAT-DOWN." The more interesting, colorful, and APPLICABLE these names are, the BETTER.

Then as a class -- we want to try to organize these things into BIG CLUSTERS. There can be STRATEGIES that seem to bridge two different clusters, for example. You move things around, create headings, etc. We'll see how this goes.

I'll try and help out as we go.

Walk through the board together. 
Where do categories overlap? 
Where do they conflict? 
What's missing? 

NOW a final challenge: Let's find these in the wild, and see how meaningful our categories are. For the sake of simplicity, look to STEAM REVIEWS or COMMENTS on REDDIT. Grab the quote, make sure you document it sufficiently (include a web link, e.g.) and add it in.

AS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THESE: IF you see examples that seem a little bit problematic, add a note that raises questions.

Before we come together next, be sure to have added at least two examples that meaningfully illuminate the STRATEGY we see.

#### Some of what I Heard and Saw on Monday, w. Observations

These are just some off-handed observations to help fill in any holes we identify as we move through the miro exercise.

1. Presented an authoritative history of a specific genre
* Authority appeal via demonstrated expertise. Establishes ethos: "I know this territory, so trust my judgment within it." Risk: can feel like gatekeeping rather than invitation.

2. Claimed to want the franchise to succeed because of his affection for it
* Identification through vulnerability. "I have a dog in this hunt." Invites the audience into a caring relationship rather than a consumer one.

3. Made friendly reference to claims by other presenters
* Social proof plus community-building. Positions the speaker as generous, not competitive. Also subtly borrows credibility from peers.

4. Offered lots of details of gameplay — this happens, then this happens, then this
* Vivid particularity, but weak. Sequence doesn't argue; it merely describes. So easy to get stuck in this trap. Often errs towards information, not persuasion. And, FWIW, we live in "the information age," also called "hell." Off the top of my head, I know how many steps I took yesterday, the exact cost of electricity per kWH in Southwestern Ohio, and how much Amazon paid for Melania Trump's shitty slideshow. None of that data makes me a better person; none of it makes the world a better place.

5. Musician spoke of his love of the soundtrack
* Credentialed testimony. Not just "I liked the music" but "I, who know music, certify this product." Leverages external expertise as ethos transfer.

6. Talks about how the game doesn't insist you take it seriously, but can enjoy "stupid builds" and ironic approaches to gameplay
* Preemptive objection-handling plus identification. Addresses the unspoken concern ("Is this too demanding? Too serious?") and hails a playful, contingent, irony-loving audience into being.

7. Argues that the game seeks to redefine how we see a specific genre, that it is far more ambitious than other exemplars
* Comparison/contrast with evaluative frame. The game isn't just good; it's historically significant. Appeals to the audience's desire to be early to something important; creates an audience that is critically-oriented.

8. Shares humorous anecdotes about events in his own gameplay
* Personal testimony plus entertainment value. Lowers argumentative temperature; makes pitch feel like a story among friends rather than explicit sales. Risk: needs to be anchored to a concrete claim or we get lost.

9. Points admiringly to games' willingness to deal with complex existential issues meaningfully
* Values alignment. "This game is serious in ways that matter." Hails ("interpellates") an audience that sees itself as thoughtful, that sees games as meaningful. Strong for the right crowd; alienating for those who think existential stuff is boring or self-inflated.

10. Want to help you get past your assumptions about this game
* Preemptive objection-handling, framed as generosity. Positions speaker as a help. "Your hesitation is understandable but uninformed; here, lemme fix that."

11. Because he wants you to play the game, he's not going to spoil the ending
* Mystery/curiosity gap plus a bit of ethical positioning. Withholds information as a gift, sign of respect. Also signals confidence: the ending is worth protecting, which hints that it is worth reaching.

12. Informal back-and-forth with audience in lieu of formal presentation
* Identification through register. Refuses the lecture frame; constructs a peer relationship. Risks diffusing the argument into chat; risks being seen as ill-prepped.

13. Teases details but doesn't fill in the blanks
* Curiosity gap. Strategic incompleteness as hook. Works if the teases are genuinely intriguing; fails if merely coy or evasive or unintelligible.

14. Use of humor
* Rapport-building, lowers defenses. Not an argument *per se* but atmospheric, contextual, as it (often) creates conditions for receptivity. Risk: can undermine earnest argument (but not always). Humor is tricky.

15. Parallels with other games, if you like X, you will love this
* Comparison/contrast plus identification. Hails a specific audience ("you, the person who liked X") and promises continuity of that. Can seem sales-y; can flatten distinctions that make the world interesting.

16. Suggests he doesn't really have time to cover the game meaningfully
* Scarcity framing (wow! this game exceeds the container), but also maybe an excuse or hedge. Possibility of persuasion is weakened (IMHO) if it reads as apology rather than testament to depth.

17. Self-deprecating humor
* Achieves ethos through vulnerability. "I'm not above you. I am one of you." Likability. Some risk, as can humanize OR it can undercut authority.

18. Poorly prepared, admits he should have replayed the game before the talk
* Honesty, but rhetorically costly. Candor earns some trust, but cedes competence. The audience may forgive the person but will discount the argument.

19. Carefully rehearsed presentation
* Ethos through preparation. Signals respect for audience and confidence in material. Risk: can feel sales-y if lacking in authenticity.

20. Clearly excited by his rehearsal of game details, gives urgent niche advice to those who might play the game
* Enthusiasm as evidence plus assumptive close. Skips persuasion and moves directly to "when you play this, here's what you need to know." Confidence is itself an argument. CAN be a strong gesture.
