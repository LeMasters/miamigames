# Valentine's Day Maze Game Assignment

### About This Assignment

There is so much to learn about Unreal Engine 5 before you really know enough to "make a game." With this assignment, which is "on-rails," we will go through the steps necessary to build, from start to finish, a really simple maze game in UE5. Development is a notoriously squishy process, and deadlines come and go: In order to underscore the urgency in our project, I've chosen to give it a "Valentine's Day" theme. That's a deadline that will not budge, no matter how heartfelt our need to add a few days to our timeline...

It is also meant as an opportunity to create something that you can share with someone else (a parent, for example, a sibling, a friend or significant other): Developers often bury themselves in a secret world full of interesting creations and powerful growth -- little projects that are meaningful to them, but invisible to the people around them. With this "on-rails" assignment, we'll go from custom maze floorplan to a finished, ready-to-ship .EXE (or .app) that you can share with others as a digital Valentine's Day card.

### Requirements

Unlike other assignments this semester, there are not many variable outcomes: A successful assignment (one that earns an "A") will follow my instructions over the next two weeks in order to create a 3rd-Person maze game that works as a standalone package, either .exe (Windows) or .app (Mac). You will have some opportunities for customization: Defining the visual theme of the maze by choosing different materials for the walls and floor, for example; adding a specific song (as an .mp3 file) to the soundtrack; choosing the specific asset to represent the goal of the maze; and (obviously) defining the messages that appear.

Advanced students are welcome to add more layers of complexity as they see fit: I encourage you always to use these assignments as opportunities to further develop your skills. But the deliverable is effectively the same.

1. Must show instructions at start with blueprint widget
2. Keyboard navigation only
3. 3rd-Person avatar
4. Entire maze must be navigable by the standard mannequin / avatar
5. Soundtrack begins on game start
6. Visible asset to indicate player goal
7. Asset rotates; detects collision; plays sound effect
8. Blueprint widget appears with message after completing maze
9. Associated human-legible README file that explains the game to your addressee (after all, we are really building a communicative artifact for Valentine's Day, not just a stand-alone executable...)

#### Notes

While this project is on-rails, it makes use of many of Unreal Engine's complex and always-changing affordances and barely-out-of-beta features. It also requires packaging for distribution. That means there are LOTS of opportunities for unexpected problems! There is no drama more edge-of-your-seat exciting, more nerve-wracking, more nail-biting, than watching your project compile in the Output log. I promise you that weird errors will raise their shaggy heads at some point during your project! Being a developer means always being prepared for unexpected setbacks.

NB: While it IS possible for a Windows box to create a Mac app, and vice versa, in practice almost NO ONE ever does this, because (1) Microsoft and (2) Apple. In its project phase (.uproject), it is fairly easy to port a game from one machine architecture to another (especially when they are as straightforward as ours). If your Significant Other is on a Windows box, and you have built your game on a Mac, then we just need to plan on compiling and play-testing your work on a different computer. Again: In complex, computationally-intensive games with networked multi-player, complex lighting scenarios, and lots of dynamic geometry, this would be deeply challenging -- you could spend a semester on this process alone. But this project is designed to avoid those problems, as best we can.

### Due Date

This project is due by **Midnight, Saturday 14 February**. 

To deliver it, .zip up your distribution folder, README file included, and upload it to CANVAS. (Self-evidently, you should delete and personal text you don't want me to see that is included in your build and/or your readme).

Once you hand it in, relax! You're done.
