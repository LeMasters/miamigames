## Policies

## Attendance

The easy version: You are required to be in class.

The nuanced version: As stated in the Student Handbook, you are expected to attend all scheduled class meetings.

The attendance policy for this course: I take roll almost every day because I value your presence here, and because years of research shows that the quality of your classmates' education and experience genuinely depends not just on what I bring to the classroom, but what you bring, too. We are all in this together.

You are allowed two unexcused class absences without penalty.  Every subsequent unexcused absence will lower your final grade by 3%. E.g., a total of 4 unexcused absences during the semester means the 88% (B+) you earned through hard work becomes instead an 82% (B–).

Seven or more unexcused absences means you will fail the course, regardless of the grade you earn through assignments. If you have already accumulated six unexcused absences when we reach the course drop deadline, I will regard you as having dropped the course, and will ask the registrar to drop you from the class.

In some cases, Illness/quarantine/family emergencies/travel for sports, etc. count as excused absences, but it falls to you to provide me with notice and documentation as soon as possible, preferably before missing class. In edge cases: The earlier I'm informed, the more likely I'm going to be to excuse it. Note that according to the University, it is up to the instructor to determine if an absence is excused or not. Do not email me before class with a note saying that you do not feel well: I will no longer characterize these as "excused" absences.

Please do not arrive late or leave early from class without talking to me beforehand.

##### Religious Observances/Student Org Trips/Athletic Competition

I will gladly excuse the student from class for a religious observance, national student org trips or athletic competition that requires the student to be absent. Please note that the Student Handbook requires the student to tell the faculty the date of the event, if officially known, in writing during the first two weeks of class. Any event not discussed with the faculty member before the occurrence will count as an unexcused absence.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence and LLMs

AI and Large-Language Models can play a powerful role in your career as a student, and in this class. But with power comes responsibility. Please do not use AI to generate code for this course. At the same time, however, I encourage you -- where useful -- to consult LLMs like ChatGPT for help on solving problems in your code.

I am fairly liberal about your use of these technologies in a class like this because they really are not very good at solving UE5 problems, and are just as likely to introduce more problems as solve them. BUT that makes them a good learning tool: In order to find utility in them, you have to help them understand your problem clearly, and then you have to implement their partially-broken solution, etc. In the end, I think that's useful.

## Cell Phones

Cell phones are a boon to humankind, and a pox upon all our houses. The reality is that casual phone use by even one person is a distraction to many. Once class begins, please stow your cell phones in your purse, your backpack, or some other container. You may retrieve them once class is over. If for some reason you must have access to your phone during class — even for a moment! — please take your phone with you and use it outside the classroom. Students who use their phone in the classroom during class hours will be asked to leave the classroom for the remainder of that day's class, and will be marked "absent."

## Classroom Climate

This course is designed to encourage active participation on the part of students. It is critical that classroom discussions are conducted in an atmosphere of tolerance and respect for the ideas of others. Please also recognize that part of my goal in this class is to facilitate intellectual exchange and foster interesting discourse. That isn't always easy to do, and — especially in a class about games — sometimes the conversations may stray far afield. Have patience when that happens, and when you can, work with me to bring the conversation back to the topic at hand.

## Late Work

Because of the size of this class, it is difficult to be flexible with assignment due dates. For this reason, late work may be significantly penalized.

## Participation

I value your active participation in this class. The size of the course can make participation daunting, but challenge yourself to contribute at least one comment or critical observation during every class. And when we work in small groups, which will happen often, strive to be an active participant. Learning is not something that happens automatically: It requires your active engagement. Your participation in class makes for a much richer and more enjoyable experience for everyone!

## Time and Effort

It is often difficult to know just how much time you should be putting into a course. As a rule of thumb in higher education in Ohio (and elsewhere!) is that for every one hour you spend in the classroom, you should be spending 2-3 hours working on material for the class outside of the classroom.

For us, that means you should plan on devoting at least 6-9 hours every week to your code. In my experience, it may be slightly more.
